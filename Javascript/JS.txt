How Javascript Works and how the code is executed?

Is Javascript synchronous or Asynchronous?

Is Javascript Single Threaded or is it Multi-threaded?

First Core Fundamental of Javascript:

"Everything in Javascript happens inside an execution context."

=> We can assume this execution context to be a big box or a container in which whole javascript is executed.

Execution Context is a big box and has two components in it.

1. The first component is also known as the memory component.

2. The Second COmponent is known as Code Component and is known as Thread Of Execution.

Javascript is a synchronous single threaded, interpreted language.
